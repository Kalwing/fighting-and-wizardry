# fighting-and-wizardry

Small text based game (door, monster, loot) in python.

![Demo](./demo.gif)

Made for the (great) [Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-language-jumpstart-building-10-apps)
course of TalkPython, I upgraded the fight system to better reflect a RPG.

## TODO :
* Rooms
* More monster variety
* Loot
